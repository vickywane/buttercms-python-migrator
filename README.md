# ButterCMS Python Content Migrator

This repository contains a python script for migrating content into ButterCMS from a static JSON or CSV file using the RESTful ButterCMS Write API. 

With little tweaks and changes to the fields, you can refactor this script to migrate your own content into your content types on ButterCMS.
